Hello,

This track has been composed when Warren Mendonsa was living in New Zealand where the weather during winter is notoriously gloomy. Warren hadn't seen the sun for days, when one day it popped out from the clouds while he was playing guitar. The song just flowed out, pretty much most of the main theme.

Yours sincerely,
Anwesh.
